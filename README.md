## Best Practices

- Use the assigned Jira ID as your branch name and create the branch from Jira directly. For example, if your task ID is "P2S-142", it will create a branch named "P2S-142" at github.
- Regularly pull the latest code and rebase with the remote branch.
- Write commit messages that are meaningful and in the present tense (git commit -m "feat: P2S-142 .....").
- Conduct thorough testing before merging changes into the develop branch.
- Request review from other developers and wait for the approval before merging with development brabch.
- The developer assignee is responsible for merging the branch when it is approved.
- After the merge, the branch has to be auto deleted from the repository.
- After completing a task, remember to checkout to a new branch.
- Strive to write code that is free of bugs.

Happy coding!
